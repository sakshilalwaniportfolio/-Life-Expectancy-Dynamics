# Life Expectancy Analysis
This project analyzes the factors influencing life expectancy using multiple regression on data from 183 countries. Key determinants, including GDP per capita, years of schooling, population, and adult mortality, explain 84% of the variation in life expectancy. Hypothesis testing validates claims on global life expectancy and polio immunization, offering data-driven insights for public health and policy decisions.

# 🌍 Factors Affecting Life Expectancy
🔹 Data-Driven Approach: Leveraging R Studio and Excel, this study aims to uncover key factors shaping life expectancy across 183 countries.

🔹 Regression & Statistical Analysis: Multiple regression models assess the impact of variables, while hypothesis testing validates global health-related claims.

🔹 Significant Findings: Using Excel for data cleaning, EDA, and statistical modeling, the study identifies GDP per capita, years of schooling, population, and adult mortality as the most influential determinants.

🔹 Public Health Implications: The insights gained contribute to a deeper understanding of longevity trends and support evidence-based decision-making in global health policies.

🔹 Reliable Data Sources: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, cross-referenced, and validated with data from the WHO website to ensure accuracy.

# 📌 Methodology
📊 Data Collection: Collected secondary data from WHO and the World Bank, covering 183 countries to analyze life expectancy trends and global health patterns.

📈 Statistical Analysis: Applied Multiple Regression in R Studio and Excel to examine how key variables influence life expectancy, providing an in-depth quantitative assessment. The model was tested for multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity to ensure reliable and unbiased estimates.

🧪 Hypothesis Testing: Conducted One-Sample T-Tests with a 95% confidence interval to validate claims about global life expectancy and immunization coverage, ensuring statistical robustness.

📉 Key Findings: Identified GDP per capita, years of schooling, mortality rates, population, and healthcare access as significant predictors of life expectancy. The study highlights how economic development, education, and healthcare improvements contribute to increased longevity.

🛠 Error & Model Refinement: The model showed a standard error of 3.31, indicating moderate prediction accuracy. Incorporating healthcare quality, lifestyle factors, and environmental conditions could enhance future predictions.

# Results
1️⃣ 📈 Model Performance: The Multiple Regression Model explained 84% of the variation in life expectancy (R² = 0.84). This high explanatory power indicates that the selected variables effectively predict life expectancy, with minimal unexplained variance, making the model statistically reliable for analyzing key determinants of global longevity.

2️⃣ 🔍 Significant Factors Influencing Life Expectancy: The study identified GDP per capita, years of schooling, adult mortality, and population as the most impactful factors. Their strong correlations suggest that economic growth, education, healthcare access, and mortality rates play a crucial role in determining life expectancy across different nations.

3️⃣ 📊 P-Value Analysis for Statistical Significance: Statistical tests confirmed that GDP per capita, years of schooling, adult mortality, and population significantly influence life expectancy (p-value < 0.05). These findings indicate that the identified factors are meaningful determinants and not the result of random chance.

4️⃣ 📏 Hypothesis Testing for Global Life Expectancy: A One-Sample T-Test was conducted to assess the BBC's claim that global life expectancy in 2015 was 71.4 years. The test results supported the claim, confirming that the reported life expectancy was statistically accurate based on the dataset.

5️⃣ 💉 Hypothesis Testing for Polio Immunization Coverage: Another One-Sample T-Test was performed to validate the claim that polio immunization coverage in 2015 was 85%. The results confirmed the claim, reinforcing the reliability of global health data and the accuracy of the dataset used in the study.

6️⃣ ⚠️ Error Analysis and Model Accuracy: The regression model's standard error of 3.31 suggests a moderate level of prediction accuracy. While the model effectively explains life expectancy variations, further refinements, incorporating healthcare quality, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices, could enhance accuracy and predictive power.

 # Conclusion-
This comprehensive analysis of life expectancy trends explores key socio-economic and health factors influencing longevity across 183 countries. By identifying critical determinants and validating global health claims, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers. To improve life expectancy worldwide, a focus should be on:

📈 Enhancing economic growth through sustainable development initiatives
🎓 Expanding access to education to improve health awareness and well-being
🏥 Strengthening healthcare systems for better disease prevention and treatment
